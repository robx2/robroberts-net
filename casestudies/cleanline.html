                <p>An ambitious project to deliver clean low-cost wind power needs more than great technology, it needs a strategy to deliver unique messages to unique audiences. </p>

                    <p><em>Partners: <a href="http://smoottewesgroup.com">Smoot Tewes Group</a></em></p>

                    <p>Wind energy is exploding across America, but faces a unique challenge. How do we move this power from the rural areas where it's abundant to the consumers and businesses in urban areas that demand low-cost renewable options? </p>

                    <p>Clean Line Energy Partners plans to build a series of High Voltage direct current transmission lines that will move power from wind farms to urban areas. The company's Plains & Eastern Clean Line would deliver power from turbines in Oklahoma to cities in the Southeast.  But building Plains & Eastern takes more than overcoming technical hurdles, Clean Line needed to tell its story and explain its benefits to a wide variety of audiences from consumers to utilities to small businesses to a multitude of federal, state and local government agencies. </p>

                    <h3>Engaging Supporters</h3>
                    <img class="img-responsive cs-image" src="../img/portfolio/thumbnails/pne.jpg" />

                    <p>Clean Line Energy had a strong communications and creative team that had already created some impressive assets to help explain the jobs, consumer and taxpayer benefits of the PLains and Eastern Clean Line. We worked with their team to reimagine a web site and video to help deliver a simple message to a more general audience.</p>

                    <p>Our <a href="http://www.plainsandeasterncleanline.com/support/">Plains & Eastern support site</a> served as our primary destination to our social media and display advertisting campaigns. The site relied on video and graphics to help explain the project and its benefits. Additionally, the site architecture used a simple narrative construction to walk users through the site and encourage them to lend their support at the end.

                    <p>We also worked with Clean Line staff to rework a 8-minute video into an easily digestable under 3 minute piece that served as the focal point of the site's home page. </p>

                    <h3>Reaching Key Audiences</h3>

                    <p>Now that we had strong creative assets, we needed to deliver audiences in key areas. Additionally, we knew that different audiences would respond to different messages. Consumers care about lower electric bills, businesses care about opportunities, government agencies care about public benefits and support.</p>

                    <img class="img-responsive cs-image-left" src="../img/casestudies/PnE-display.png" />

                    <p>Working with Clean Line's creative team, we developed a coordinated campaign to spread the Plains & Eastern message. The campaign used a wide variety of tools from social media messaging to display advertising to sponsorship of newsletters popular with Washington insiders.</p>

                    <p>Our advertising campaigns were customized to maximize visibility at reasonable expense. We used a variety of geographic, demographic and behavorial targeting to reach key audiences in strategic locations.</p>

                    <p>Our combined efforts paid off as Clean Line was able to demonstate clear support for the project from consumers who were looking for renewable options. This support helped bolster a case for broader government support of the project.</p>
